## 🔐 Authentication Routes (UserController)

### ✅ User Authentication & Session Management:
```
POST /user/register    - User registration
POST /user/login       - User login
POST /user/logout      - User logout
GET  /user/my-profile  - Current user profile (session-based)
GET  /user/check-session - Check login status
GET  /user/admin-only  - Admin-only content
```

### ✅ User CRUD Operations:
```
GET    /user           - Get all users
GET    /user/:id       - Get specific user
PUT    /user/:id       - Complete user update
PATCH  /user/:id/phone - Update phone only
PATCH  /user/:id/status - Update status only
DELETE /user/:id       - Delete user
GET    /user/null-names - Special query
```

## 👤 Profile Management Routes (ProfileController)

### ✅ Profile CRUD Operations:
```
POST   /user/:id/profile  - Create user profile
GET    /user/:id/profile  - Get user profile  
PATCH  /user/:id/profile  - Update user profile
DELETE /user/:id/profile  - Delete user profile
GET    /profiles          - Get all profiles
```

## 🎫 Booking Management Routes (BookingController)

### ✅ Booking Operations:
```

```

## 🚌 Route Separation Strategy

### ✅ Authentication vs Profile - CLEAR SEPARATION:

**Authentication Routes (Session-based):**
- `/user/my-profile` → Current logged-in user's basic info from session
- `/user/login` → Login and create session
- `/user/logout` → Destroy session

**Profile Management Routes (Database-based):**
- `/user/:id/profile` → Detailed profile management for specific user
- Requires user ID parameter
- Full CRUD operations

### 🎯 Benefits of This Structure:

1. **✅ No Route Conflicts:** 
   - `/user/my-profile` (specific) vs `/user/:id/profile` (dynamic with sub-resource)
   - Different patterns, no overlap

2. **✅ Logical Separation:**
   - Authentication → User session management
   - Profile → User data management

3. **✅ RESTful Design:**
   - Follows REST conventions
   - Clear resource hierarchy

4. **✅ Intuitive API:**
   - Easy to understand
   - Predictable endpoints

## 🧪 Testing Examples:

### Authentication Testing:
```bash
# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/user/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123"}' \
  -c cookies.txt

# Get current user profile (session-based)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/user/my-profile \
  -b cookies.txt
```

### Profile Management Testing:
```bash
# Create detailed profile for user
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/user/1/profile \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"bio": "Software Developer", "address": "Dhaka"}' \
  -b cookies.txt

# Get user's detailed profile
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/user/1/profile \
  -b cookies.txt
```
